# why Excel is so popular? The 1980s launched and is still popular why?
- The reason is Excell is very intuitive, everything can be seen in front of the Excel application
    - we can see and understand how the data looks like
    - what are the rows and columns
    - when we are doing some operation we can understand which Row and column are being used
- very human interactive that's why it's still relevant (very good UI design)

- Excel Column are shown in Alphabetical order { A to Z} then again start with {AA - AZ} and again {BA - BZ} and so on
- Excel Rows are shown in number {1 to 1 million}

# Famous Interview Question?
 ## How many total ROws are in Excel? and how much data we can store.
  - If we press `cntrl` + `Down Arrow` then we get to the last Row and that Row number is {10 lakh 48 thousand 576}
  - A maximum of roughly 1 million data can be stored on an Excel application.
  - In the Excel website version it can go up to 5 million.

## Every Excell cell has a unique address like A2, B2, B12
- Excell address start with [COlumn Name] [Row Number]

## Where the font tools are used like `Bold, italic, center, letter upper and lower case, and heading highlight`?
- These all are things used in the Excell dashboard making it look like the dashboard pretty

## Excel is a calculation tool.
- mainly we will deal with the data tab

- **Excel's Collaboration Limits**: Excel is not designed for multiple users to work on the same file simultaneously, leading to conflicts.
- **Databases Support Multi-User Access**: Databases allow multiple users to access and modify data concurrently without overwriting each other’s work.

### 4. Data Relationships and Complex Queries
- **Excel's Limits in Managing Relationships**: Excel can handle simple lookups, but managing complex relationships between tables is cumbersome.
- **Databases Handle Complex Relationships**: Databases support relational data models where tables can be linked via keys, enabling complex queries using SQL.

### 5. Data Security and Permissions
- **Excel's Basic Security**: Excel files can be password-protected but offer limited security features.
- **Databases Offer Robust Security**: Databases provide role-based access control, allowing administrators to set permissions for different users.

### 6. Data Backup and Recovery
- **Excel’s Manual Backup**: Excel files require manual backup or cloud services for version control.
- **Databases Have Built-in Backup**: Databases have automatic backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data is not lost in case of failure.

### 7. Automation and Efficiency
- **Excel’s Limited Automation**: Excel supports automation via VBA, but this is limited to specific files.
- **Databases Automate Tasks Efficiently**: Databases automate repetitive tasks using triggers, stored procedures, and scripts, making data handling more efficient.

### 8. Complex Queries and Reporting
- **Excel's Query Limitations**: Excel supports basic filtering and pivot tables but struggles with large datasets and complex queries.
- **Databases Are Designed for Complex Queries**: Databases use SQL for querying, joining, and aggregating data from multiple tables efficiently.

### 9. Version Control
- **Excel’s Versioning Challenges**: Excel files are often saved as separate versions, leading to confusion and possible data loss.
- **Databases Handle Version Control**: Databases offer transaction logging and history tracking, providing an audit trail of changes made to the data.

### 10. Data Access Across Platforms
- **Excel's Access Limitations**: Excel files are typically accessed via local copies, which can make sharing data across platforms cumbersome.

### Advantages:
- Supports complex data structures, formulas, and formatting.
- Ideal for storing datasets that require detailed formatting and calculations.
- Offers features like multiple sheets, cell formatting, and chart embedding.

### Disadvantages:
- Larger file size compared to CSV due to additional formatting and data structure information.
- Requires specific software (like Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet applications) to create and view.

## When to Use CSV:
- **Data Exchange**: Use CSV when exchanging data between different software applications or systems that support the CSV format.
- **Large Datasets**: CSV is preferable for large datasets where file size and processing speed are concerns.
- **Simplicity**: When the data doesn't require complex formatting or formulas.

## When to Use XLSX:
- **Complex Data**: Use XLSX when your data requires complex formatting, multiple sheets, formulas, or embedded charts.
- **Data Analysis**: If you need to perform detailed data analysis, XLSX is often more suitable due to its support for formulas and structured data.

## Summary
- **Choose CSV** for simplicity, compatibility, and efficiency with large datasets.
- **Opt for XLSX** when your data requires advanced formatting, calculations, or multiple sheets.

## Excel Formula
- Excel formula use or start with `=(formula)`
- After applying the formula in one column when we drag the column for multiple columns the formula automatically adjusts this is the most underrated feature of excel

## What is aggregation function?
- I have a group of data after summarizing the whole group of data to come up one number is called aggregation function it could be (sum,avg,median...)

## To select the whole column Data we have to press `{cntrl + shift + down Arrow}` 
## To edit any formula we have to press `{Fn + F2}`


### **My Avg = 330 and median = 225 so is my data Right Skeweed or left Skeweed by knowing these 2 values?**
- if my Avg > median then the distribution will be right skewed. the outliers are towards the maximum value.
- if my Avg < median then the distribution will be left skewed the outliers are towards the minimum value.
- Skweed means that my data has a lot of outliers
